# Better Chat

Adds the following features to the chat panel:
- Ability to set the fade out delay (default is 15 seconds)
- Ability to set the position

It's strongly recommended to use Outward Config Manager.

Planned features:
- Drag and drop the chat panel instead of editing the position value
- Highlight/show new messages when not focused
- Ability to resize the chat panel
- Mod compatibility (some mod keybinds ignore that the chat is open)
- Ability to change font size
- Ability to link items in chat
